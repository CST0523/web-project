Green Trips is your gateway to sustainable and convenient commuting, designed to reduce city traffic, cut emissions, and foster a community of eco-conscious commuters. 
Our platform promotes green living through carpooling connections, eco-friendly travel tips, and supports Sustainable Development Goal 11 for sustainable cities. 
Built on a robust tech stack of HTML, CSS, AJAX, JSON, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, our website provides a seamless user experience. Users can register, track real-time transport, 
find carpools, reserve e-scooters, and more, with feedback driving continuous improvement. Our dedicated admin team maintains high standards, manages bookings, and supports users, 
ensuring the site remains efficient and aligned with its green mission.
